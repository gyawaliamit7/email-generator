## Features

- **Builder Pattern**: Spring HTML Generator leverages the Builder pattern to construct HTML pages, providing a clean and intuitive way to generate dynamic HTML content programmatically.

- **Lightweight**: This application is designed to be minimalistic and lightweight, ensuring that it doesn't introduce unnecessary complexity to your project.

- **Dependency-Free**: You won't need to manage any external dependencies when using Spring HTML Generator. It relies solely on Java, making it easy to integrate into your existing Java projects.

## Use Cases

Spring HTML Generator can be incredibly useful in various scenarios where you need to generate and serve HTML content from your backend:

1. **Composing HTML Emails**: When you need to compose HTML emails dynamically and send them from your backend, this library simplifies the task by providing a structured way to create HTML templates.

2. **Serving HTML Pages**: If your application serves HTML pages directly from the backend, Spring HTML Generator streamlines the process, making your code cleaner and more maintainable.

3. **Improving Readability**: Traditional approaches to generating HTML content within Java code often result in convoluted and hard-to-maintain code. Spring HTML Generator is designed with readability in mind, making it easier for developers to understand and maintain.
